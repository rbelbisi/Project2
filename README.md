# Project2
Project 2 for Database and Design Class 
Attached to this Repository is a zip file called Project 2 which contains:
1) 5 files called Station.json, Users.json, Admin.json, Status.json, and Trips.json.
2) 1) All my queries named Query1.js, Query2.js, Query 3.js, Query4.js, Query5.js.
3) It also has 5 csv files which contain all 5 query results.

I did these queries by using mongo compass by following these steps: 
1) In Compass, click on the “Databases” tab, then “Create Database” to set up a new database.
2) With the database and collection created, you should see options to insert and import data within the collection view.
3) Click on the “Add Data” dropdown and select “Import File”. Choose the JSON file you want to import.
This imports the data and allows for queries to be created.

For the data collected, I used 4 tables from SF Bay Area Bikeshare from Kaggle and created two tables ‘users’ and ‘admins’ from Mackaroo. I joined them together on the db browser, created json files for each table then uploaded them into MongoDB Compass to complete my project.
